# Sentiment-aware Hybrid Recommendation System

> **"Moving beyond 'What's Popular' to 'What's Good'."**

A Final Year Project that combats "Analysis Paralysis" and misleading Star Ratings in e-commerce. This system integrates **NLP Sentiment Analysis** into a **Hybrid Recommendation Engine** to prioritize consumer trust and safety over simple sales volume (Aligned with SDG 12).

## Project Overview

Standard e-commerce recommenders rely heavily on Collaborative Filtering (User-Item interactions) and Star Ratings. However, these suffer from:

1. **Star Rating Bias:** High ratings often hide negative textual feedback.
2. **Cold Start Problem:** New users get generic, irrelevant suggestions.
3. **Trust Gap:** Users don't understand *why* an item is recommended ("Black Box" algorithms).

**This solution** builds an "Sentiment-aware Recommender" that:

* Extracts sentiment scores from text reviews using **Naïve Bayes**.
* Fuses Sentiment with User Behavior using **SVD++** (Matrix Factorization).
* Provides **Explainable AI (XAI)** insights using Google Gemini.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Hybrid Recommendation Engine 

Combines **Collaborative Filtering (SVD++)** and **Content-Based Filtering** (TF-IDF Similarity). It uses an **Augmented Rating** formula to rank items:

### 2. Explainable AI Consultant (XAI) 

An integrated "Floating Assistant" powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**. It analyzes search results in real-time to provide:

* **"The Winner":** Why the top result matches the user's intent.
* **"The Alternative":** A high-sentiment backup option.
* **Social Proof:** Specific sentiment percentages (e.g., "94% positive feedback").

### 4. Sentiment-Aware Search

A dual-strategy search engine (Regex + Vector Similarity) that visualizes "True Quality" using color-coded sentiment badges rather than just stars.

---

## System Architecture

The project follows a decoupled **Client-Server** architecture:

* **Frontend:** React.js (Context API for state management).
* **Backend:** Python Flask (REST API).
* **Data Processing:** Pandas (In-memory DataFrame handling).
* **Machine Learning:**
* *Sentiment:* Multinomial Naïve Bayes (Optimized).
* *Recommender:* SVD++ (Surprise Library).
* *Summarization:* Google Gemini API.

---

## Usage Guide

1. **Cold Start Discovery:**
* Open the homepage. Even as a new user, you will see a "Discovery Feed" generated by the Content-Based engine using metadata diversity.


2. **Smart Search:**
* Type a query (e.g., *"Iron"* or *"Gaming Mouse"*).
* Observe the **Floating AI Bubble** processing the top 8 results to generate a comparative summary.


3. **Check Safety Modal:**
* Find a product with a **Red Sentiment Badge** (<40%).
* Try to click **"Add to Cart"**.
* The system will trigger the Safety Intervention Warning.

## Model Performance

### Sentiment Analysis (Multinomial Naïve Bayes)

Selected for its superior recall on negative reviews compared to Deep Learning models (BERT/LSTM) on this specific dataset.
| Metric | Score | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Negative Recall** | **92.59%** | Critical for safety features. |
| **Accuracy** | 96.30% | Robust classification. |
| **Macro F1** | 0.61 | Balanced performance. |

### Recommendation Engine (Hybrid SVD++)

Validated via an Ablation Study comparing Pure CF vs. Hybrid.
| Metric | Pure CF | **Hybrid (Ours)** | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RMSE** | 1.2076 | **0.8537** | Lower error (Better Rating Prediction) |
| **Hit Rate @ 5** | 0.69% | **34.72%** | **+34% Retrieval Accuracy** |

*The Hybrid model successfully solved the "Cold Start" problem where Pure CF failed.*

## Future Roadmap

* **Temporal Dynamics:** Implement time-decay weighting to prioritize recent reviews over older ones.
* **Session-Based Logic:** Integrate RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) to personalize recommendations for guest users based on real-time clicks.
* **Advanced NLP:** Upgrade to **DistilBERT** (Knowledge Distillation) to improve nuance detection (sarcasm) without sacrificing inference speed.
